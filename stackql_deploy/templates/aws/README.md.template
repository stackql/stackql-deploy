# `stackql-deploy` starter project for `aws`

> for starter projects using other providers, try `stackql-deploy {{ stack_name }} --provider=azure` or `stackql-deploy {{ stack_name }} --provider=google`

## Overview

__`stackql-deploy`__ is a stateless, declarative, SQL driven Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) framework.  There is no state file required as the current state is assessed for each resource at runtime.  __`stackql-deploy`__ is capable of provisioning, deprovisioning and testing a stack which can include resources across different providers, like a stack spanning `aws` and `azure` for example.  

## Prerequisites

This example requires `stackql-deploy` to be installed using __`pip install stackql-deploy`__.  The host used to run `stackql-deploy` needs the necessary environment variables set to authenticate to your specific provider, in the case of the `aws` provider, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and optionally `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` must be set, for more information on authentication to `aws` see the [`aws` provider documentation](https://aws.stackql.io/providers/aws).

## Usage

Adjust the values in the [__`stackql_manifest.yml`__](stackql_manifest.yml) file if desired.  The [__`stackql_manifest.yml`__](stackql_manifest.yml) file contains resource configuration variables to support multiple deployment environments, these will be used for `stackql` queries in the `resources` folder.  

The syntax for the `stackql-deploy` command is as follows:

```bash
stackql-deploy { build | test | teardown } { stack-directory } { deployment environment} [ optional flags ]
``` 

### Deploying a stack

For example, to deploy the stack named {{ stack_name }} to an environment labeled `sit`, run the following:

```bash
stackql-deploy build {{ stack_name }} sit \
-e AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2
```

Use the `--dry-run` flag to view the queries to be run without actually running them, for example:

```bash
stackql-deploy build {{ stack_name }} sit \
-e AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2 \
--dry-run
```

### Testing a stack

To test a stack to ensure that all resources are present and in the desired state, run the following (in our `sit` deployment example):

```bash
stackql-deploy test {{ stack_name }} sit \
-e AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2
```

### Tearing down a stack

To destroy or deprovision all resources in a stack for our `sit` deployment example, run the following:

```bash
stackql-deploy teardown {{ stack_name }} sit \
-e AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-2
```

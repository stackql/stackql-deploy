**Type**: `array of strings` (optional)

**Description**: List of variable names to export to a JSON file after deployment completion. Variables must exist in the deployment context (from globals or resource exports). Use with the `--output-file` CLI argument to specify the destination file.

**Usage**: Use this to extract key deployment outputs for use in CI/CD pipelines, downstream processes, or for record-keeping.

**Example**:

```yaml
exports:
  - databricks_workspace_name
  - databricks_workspace_id  
  - aws_iam_role_arn
  - deployment_timestamp
```

**Notes**:
- `stack_name`, `stack_env`, and `elapsed_time` are automatically included in exports and do not need to be listed
- Export order: automatic exports (`stack_name`, `stack_env`) first, then user-defined exports, then timing (`elapsed_time`) last
- `elapsed_time` is formatted as a string showing the total deployment duration (e.g., "0:01:23.456789")
- Variables are exported exactly as they exist in the deployment context
- Complex objects and arrays are preserved as JSON structures  
- If a listed variable doesn't exist in the context, deployment will fail
- Requires `--output-file` CLI argument to be specified, otherwise exports are skipped
- Exported JSON file contains a flat object with variable names as keys

When set to `true`, the `test` and `build` commands will bypass validation checks for this specific resource. This is particularly useful for resources that are initially created with placeholder values and later updated within the same stack.

:::info

- Use `skip_validation: true` when you need to create a resource with temporary configuration that will be updated later in the stack execution
- Common use cases include:
  - Creating IAM roles with placeholder external IDs that will be updated once another dependent resource is created
  - Setting up initial placeholder credentials that will be modified in a subsequent step
  - Creating resources with circular dependencies where initial validation would fail
- This flag only affects the `test` and `build` commands

## About The Project

[**`stackql-deploy`**][pypi] is an open-source command line utility which implements a declarative, model driven framework to deploy and manage multi cloud stacks using [**`stackql`**][stackqlrepo]. [**`stackql-deploy`**][pypi] is distributed as a Python script to be used as a CLI tool, do the following to get started:
<br />

```bash
pip install stackql-deploy
```

> **Note for macOS users**  
> to install `stackql-deploy` in a virtual environment (which may be necessary on **macOS**), use the following:
>
> ```bash
> python3 -m venv myenv
> source myenv/bin/activate
> pip install stackql-deploy
> ```

## About StackQL

StackQL is a utility which allows you to query and interact with cloud and SaaS resources in real time using SQL grammar. StackQL supports a full set of SQL query/DML grammar, including `JOIN`, `UNION` adn subquery functionality and supports mutation operations on cloud and SaaS resources such as `create`, `update` and `delete`, implemented as `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` respectively. StackQL also supports grammar for performing lifecycle operations such as starting or stopping a VM using the `EXEC` statement.

StackQL provider definitions are defined in plaintext OpenAPI extensions to the providers specification. These definitions are then used to generate the SQL schema and the API client. The source for the provider definitions are stored in the [**StackQL Registry**][registry].

## How it works

<!-- > see [__readthedocs__]() for more detailed documentation -->

A **`stackql-deploy`** project is a directory containing StackQL scripts with a manifest file at the root of the directory, for example:

```
├── example_stack
│   ├── resources
│   │   └── monitor_resource_group.iql
│   ├── stackql_manifest.yml
```

the `stackql_manifest.yml` defines the resources in the stackql with their properties which can be scoped by environments, for example:

```yaml
version: 1
name: example_stack
description: oss activity monitor stack
providers:
    - azure
globals:
    - name: subscription_id
    description: azure subscription id
    value: "{{ vars.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}"
    - name: location
    value: eastus
    - name: resource_group_name_base
    value: "activity-monitor"
resources:
    - name: monitor_resource_group
    description: azure resource group for activity monitor
    props:
        - name: resource_group_name
        description: azure resource group name
        value: "{{ globals.resource_group_name_base }}-{{ globals.stack_env }}"
        # OR YOU CAN DO...
        # values:
        #   prd:
        #     value: "activity-monitor-prd"
        #   sit:
        #     value: "activity-monitor-sit"
        #   dev:
        #     value: "activity-monitor-dev"
```

> use `stackql-deploy init {stack_name}` to create a project directory with sample files

Deployment orchestration using `stackql-deploy` includes:

- **_pre-flight_** checks, which are StackQL queries that check for the existence or current configuration state of a resource
- **_deployment_** scripts, which are StackQL queries to create or update resoruces (or delete in the case of de-provisioning)
- **_post-deployment_** tests, which are StackQL queries to confirm that resources were deployed and have the desired state

**Performance Optimization**: `stackql-deploy` uses an intelligent query optimization strategy which is described here:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Start] --> B{foreach\nresource}
    B --> C{exports query\navailable?}
    C -- Yes --> D[try exports first\n🔄 optimal path]
    C -- No --> E[exists\ncheck]
    D --> F{exports\nsuccess?}
    F -- Yes --> G[✅ validated with\n1 query only]
    F -- No --> E
    E --> H{resource\nexists?}
    H -- Yes --> I[run update\nor createorupdate query]
    H -- No --> J[run create\nor createorupdate query]
    I --> K[run statecheck check]
    J --> K
    G --> L[reuse exports result]
    K --> M{End}
    L --> M
```

### `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` queries

Mutation operations are defined as `.iql` files in the `resources` directory, these are templates that are rendered with properties or environment context variables at run time, for example:

```sql
/*+ create */
INSERT INTO azure.resources.resource_groups(
    resourceGroupName,
    subscriptionId,
    data__location
)
SELECT
    '{{ resource_group_name }}',
    '{{ subscription_id }}',
    '{{ location }}'

/*+ update */
UPDATE azure.resources.resource_groups
SET data__location = '{{ location }}'
WHERE resourceGroupName = '{{ resource_group_name }}'
    AND subscriptionId = '{{ subscription_id }}'

/*+ delete */
DELETE FROM azure.resources.resource_groups
WHERE resourceGroupName = '{{ resource_group_name }}' AND subscriptionId = '{{ subscription_id }}'
```

### Test Queries

Test files are defined as `.iql` files in the `resources` directory, these files define the per-flight and post-deploy checks to be performed, for example:

```sql
/*+ exists */
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM azure.resources.resource_groups
WHERE subscriptionId = '{{ subscription_id }}'
AND resourceGroupName = '{{ resource_group_name }}'

/*+ statecheck, retries=5, retry_delay=5 */
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM azure.resources.resource_groups
WHERE subscriptionId = '{{ subscription_id }}'
AND resourceGroupName = '{{ resource_group_name }}'
AND location = '{{ location }}'
AND JSON_EXTRACT(properties, '$.provisioningState') = 'Succeeded'

/*+ exports */
SELECT resourceGroupName, location, JSON_EXTRACT(properties, '$.provisioningState') as state
FROM azure.resources.resource_groups
WHERE subscriptionId = '{{ subscription_id }}'
AND resourceGroupName = '{{ resource_group_name }}'
```

### Query Optimization

`stackql-deploy` implements intelligent query optimization that significantly improves performance:

**Traditional Flow (3 queries):**
1. `exists` - check if resource exists
2. `statecheck` - validate resource configuration  
3. `exports` - extract variables for dependent resources

**Optimized Flow (1 query in happy path):**
1. **Try `exports` first** - if this succeeds, it validates existence, state, and extracts variables in one operation
2. **Fallback to traditional flow** only if exports fails

**Performance Benefits:**
- Up to **66% reduction** in API calls for existing, correctly configured resources
- **2-3x faster** deployments in typical scenarios
- Maintains full validation integrity and backward compatibility

**Best Practice:** Design your `exports` queries to include the validation logic from `statecheck` queries to maximize the benefits of this optimization.

## Usage

<!-- > see [__readthedocs__]() for more detailed documentation -->

Once installed, use the `build`, `test`, or `teardown` commands as shown here:

```
stackql-deploy build prd example_stack -e AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --dry-run
stackql-deploy build prd example_stack -e AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
stackql-deploy test prd example_stack -e AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
stackql-deploy teardown prd example_stack -e AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

> **Note:** `teardown` deprovisions resources in reverse order to creation

Additional options include:

- `--dry-run`: perform a dry run of the stack operations.
- `--on-failure=rollback`: action on failure: rollback, ignore or error.
- `--env-file=.env`: specify an environment variable file.
- `-e KEY=value`: pass additional environment variables.
- `--log-level`: logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), defaults to INFO.
